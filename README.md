# BusTrackingSystem
This project main aim is to find the location of the bus and send it to the user.

**OVERVIEW:**

The system can be accessed by passengers through a web-based interface or a mobile application, which provides real-time
information about the bus's location, estimated arrival time, and any delays or disruptions. Transportation authorities and fleet managers can also access the system to optimize routes and schedules, monitor fuel consumption and driver performance, and enhance the overall efficiency of their operations.The bus tracking system can be implemented in various types of buses, including public transportation, school buses, corporate shuttles, and tourist buses. It can also be customized to 
meet the specific needs of different transportation providers and end-users.Overall, the bus tracking system is a valuable tool that enhances the safety, efficiency, and quality of public transportation services by providing accurate and up-to-date information about the location and movements of buses.

**IMPORTANCE:**

Bus tracking systems are essential tools for transportation companies for various reasons, including:Real-time monitoring,
Improved safety, Efficient fleet management, Enhanced customer service, Cost savings.Overall, bus tracking systems are critical tools for transportation companies to manage their fleets efficiently, improve safety and customer satisfaction, and save costs.

**TOOLS USED:**

GPS Module, GSM Module, Arduino Uno,10k Pot, LCD Display.

**WORKING**

A bus tracking system using a GPS module, GSM module, Arduino Uno, and an LCD display can provide real-time location tracking and display the bus's location on the LCD display. The system works as follows:
1. The GPS module receives signals from GPS satellites and calculates the bus's coordinates.
2. The Arduino Uno reads the GPS coordinates from the GPS module and stores them in its memory.
3. The GSM module uses a SIM card to establish a cellular data connection with the Internet.
4. The Arduino Uno sends the GPS coordinates to a cloud-based server or an online database using the GSM module and cellular data connection.
5. A web application or mobile app retrieves the GPS coordinates from the cloud-based server or online database and processes them to display the bus's real-time location on a map.
6. The Arduino Uno retrieves the bus's location information from the web application or mobile app and displays it on the LCD display.
This system allows bus operators and passengers to track the bus's location in real-time, making it easier to plan their travel routes and schedules..
